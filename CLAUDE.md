You now have just **2 markdown files**:
- **README.md** - Main documentation with setup, usage, and reference
- **QUERY_GUIDE.md** - Focused on querying and performance monitoring

Both files are concise while retaining all essential information. The documentation is more maintainable with no redundancy.
Dont create any new md files at all. If needed, prompt to very concisely update these two files.
